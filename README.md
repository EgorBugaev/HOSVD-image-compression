## HOSVD-image-compression
HSE FCS summer practice supplementary material.

## Description
Practice consisted of implementing a Higher Dimension Singular Value Decomposition algorithm from [1] and applying it in low resolution PNG image compression.  

Detailed description and achieved results are demonstrated in pdf document. 

## Run parameters
All in input.txt file.    
First line - input file name.  
Second line - output file name.  
Third line - compression rate integer (defines the part of the singular values that is saved).
